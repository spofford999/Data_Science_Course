# Currency Converter project ðŸ’°

## Introduction

The aim of this formative assignment is to create a simple project in HTML. For this I chose to create a currency converter.
It should be deployed via a remote repository such as Github. A project kanban board and ticketing system should be created for the project.
The project should be documented in this README using appropriate Markdown language. Use a type of testing such as Figma to prototype/test the idea.

## HTML Code

I have minimal experience with HTML code, so I sourced help from a YouTube tutorial provided by Aamir Projects (2019). This tutorial showed how to make a currency converter to convert Pakistan rupees to various currencies. I adapted this HTML code to convert British pounds (GBP) to Euros (EU). I specifically chose this as I had recently been on a work trip to Italy. The result of the code can be seen below. It was a very simple piece of html code and multiplies the value entered in to the Pounds box by 1.16 to convert to Euros. A rest button clears the data from both fields.

## Project Management

### Issues
Various issues were created to track the stages of the project. Issues can be assigned to specific users and tagged with labels based on the work type. In this instance all issues were assigned to me but in a larger group project this would be an effective way to share workload.
