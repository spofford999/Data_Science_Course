# Currency Converter project ðŸ’°

## Introduction
The aim of this formative assignment is to create a simple project in HTML. For this I chose to create a currency converter.
It should be deployed via a remote repository such as Github. A project kanban board and ticketing system should be created for the project.
The project should be documented in this README using appropriate Markdown language. Use a type of testing such as Figma to prototype/test the idea.

## HTML Code
I have minimal experience with HTML code, so I sourced help from a YouTube tutorial provided by Aamir Projects (2019). This tutorial showed how to make a currency converter to convert Pakistan rupees to various currencies. I adapted this HTML code to convert British pounds (GBP) to Euros (EU). I specifically chose this as I had recently been on a work trip to Italy. The result of the code can be seen below. It was a very simple piece of html code and multiplies the value entered in to the Pounds box by 1.16 to convert to Euros. A rest button clears the data from both fields.

## Project Management

### Issues
The issues section can be located in the issues tab of the repository. For this project various issues/tasks were created for this project. Issues can be assigned to specific users and tagged with labels based on the work type. In this instance all issues were assigned to me but in a larger group project this would be an effective way to share workload.

### Kanban
The kanban board can be located in the project tab of the repository. It is an effective tool to visualise the status of a project based on the status of the various issues/tasks raised. The label feature also provide more clarity to the task type. This screenshot is of the project that is not fully completed yet as you can see there are still items in the Todo, In Progress and In Review. A suggestion to also add a dollar conversion has been labelled as an enhancement task, where as another request to change the font as been labelled as 'wont fix', as it was deemed not required for the project.

## Testing
Due to wanting to gain feedback on this formative assignment to understand my Github work. I decided for this submission to only create a quick prototype using Figma to provide an idea of how the concept could work. At present the design does not match the design in the html code. A further activity will be to watch the Figma videos in module 3, for a better understanding of the functionality available.

## Summary
Github was used to store html code and a readme file explain this small project to create a simple currency converter. Within the repository, issues were created and then logged within the project using a kanban system. Basic prototyping was done but this is an areas that needs further attention for future assignment submissions.
